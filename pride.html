<div class="parag"><span class="cY">2.</span> The last time I found myself unable to stop doing something, losing track of time, I was programming, I am constantly working on personal projects that end up taking much of my time, but I enjoy it.<br></div>
<div class="parag"><span class="cY">3.</span> My friends and family would say to me that I should be working at a big company like Google or Apple.<br></div>
<div class="parag"><span class="cY">4.</span> The last time I lost sleep over an idea I had was not that long ago, after programming for long periods of time I tend to continue thinking about what I was working on for long after.<br></div>
<div class="parag"><span class="cY">5.</span> The last time I completed an idea with better execution than I expected of me was not too long ago, often when working on personal projects in my free time I realize how my skills have grown.<br></div>
<div class="parag"><span class="cY">6.</span> I would donate my time for the cause of keeping absolutely everything organized, for the good of everyone.<br></div>
<div class="parag"><span class="cY">7.</span> If I were to win the lottery, after a year I would hopefully have made the proper investments, allowing me to live a normal life but with less of the stress that people have from financial troubles. I wouldn’t buy an unnecessarily huge mansion and fancy car, I would probably hide the fact that I had excessive amounts of money.<br></div>
<div class="parag"><span class="cY">8.</span> The job I plan on pursuing is a Software Engineer, but I would also enjoy a more creative career like Graphic Designer or something the lines of that.<br></div>
<div class="parag"><span class="cY">9.</span> I am definitely going to pursue my passion as much as I possibly can, immediately.<br></div>

	<div class="dark centext">
		<div class="divider2 cD">...</div>
		<div class="parag">The people in your life change you as a person, everyone, all your interactions create feelings within you. As a person you may acknowledge those feelings and the person who stimulated them. Not all of these feelings may not be positive, but they matter and cannot be ignored. Relationships are everything in your life, the people you see everyday and those you see once in a few years all make an impact on you as much as you do to them. If you are treated with a negative fashion you are likely to remember that moment, but even if you start to form a grudge because of it you must continue to hold that respect you have for that person. Everyone deserves respect, we all start with a clean slate and despite a reputation some may have they are still a person. Respecting someone isn’t a requirement, but as as a person you must acknowledge that there is always a reason behind everything. You may feel that someone isn’t deserving of respect by the way they act, but truly you know that your feelings do not permit you to disrespect them. Respect is more than how you think of a person, it is also in the actions you take that directly involve someone. Typical respectful actions like greeting someone and holding a door open are simple enough that you and that person may not think of it again a after a short time. Being respectful is not only what you do, but what you don’t do. Speaking to someone you respect, thanking them for existing and changing your life. Now that is respect.</div>
